> Codecam is a mobile app that allows users to take a photo of their code. They have the option to run the code and edit it anytime. Photos taken are easily accessed through the history tab in which picture, picture content, date and title name are represented and sorted
> 
> It supports more than 5 programming languages such as Javascript, Java and Python

### User Stories
- As a teacher, I want to know if my student's code output is correct
- As an intellectual coder, I want to easily test my hypothesis 
- As a developer, I want to discover new ways to code

> This design was planned before on paper, then moved to Figma app for the fine details.
Note that i didn't use any styling library or theme, all from scratch and using pure css modules

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the CodeCam app uses:

- This project uses the [React Native app development framework](https://reactnative.dev/). React Native combines the best parts of native development with React, a best-in-class JavaScript library for building user interfaces..
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) library which allows the app to create a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model the application data.

- The app uses the font ["Roboto"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) as its main font for Android, and it uses ["san Francisco"](https://www.dafontfree.io/san-francisco-font-free) as its main font for IOS.
